# quiz

## Description

My application allows a user to take a timed quiz once they click the start button. I hid the start section after the user clicked the button and this prompted my site to the start the timer and display my questions. One of the challenges I faced was getting my content to show up after I hid the start section. I honestly spent most of my time on that, so I wasn't able to create the rest of the pages.
